## Day 6

* In class demonstration of the concepts we covered last class

* Prototype / Sketch review

### Homework

* For next class complete your three page website on the _important issue you care about_, focusing on structural layout and navigation using DIVs.

* While this site doesn't _need_ to read like a wikipedia article, and you can be creative, you must clearly communicate some perspective or detail about the issue you have chosen.

* This is a three page website with some kind of navigation that carries through across all three pages.

* As alwaysâ€“ strive to make something you are proud of.
